# Paras Visuals

Welcome to **Paras Visuals**, my Photographer Portfolio project! This website showcases my photography work and provides visitors with an easy way to navigate through my portfolio, blog, and contact information.

## Project Overview

This project is built using WordPress and includes four main pages:

1. **Home Page**: Features a stunning hero section created with the Prime Slider plugin and an image gallery using the Modular plugin.
2. **Portfolio Page**: Displays a collection of my photography work, organized for easy viewing.
3. **Blog Page**: A space for sharing insights, tips, and stories related to photography.
4. **Contact Me Page**: Allows visitors to reach out through a contact form powered by the Contact Form 7 plugin.

## Video Showcase

To give viewers a better understanding of the design and layout of each page, I've created videos showcasing the four main sections of the portfolio. You can watch them here:
